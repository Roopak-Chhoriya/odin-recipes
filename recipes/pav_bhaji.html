          </ul>

        <h4>Steps -</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and 
            1/4 teaspoon salt; fry until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Add garlic; cook and
             stir for 4 minutes. Pour in 1 cup water. Add 1 teaspoon pav bhaji masala 
             and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 
             until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Add tomatoes, potatoes, and corn to the saucepan. Season with chile powder, 
            coriander, and ginger. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. 
            Mash curry gently with the back of a wooden spoon or spatula. Simmer for 10 minutes more.
            Taste and adjust salt. Add 1/2 teaspoon pav bhaji masala and lemon juice. Mash slightly again.
          </li>
          <li>Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to give curry a runny consistency. Add remaining 1 tablespoon 
            oil and butter; stir until butter is melted. Divide into serving bowls and sprinkle remaining 
            pav bhaji masala on top.
          </li>
